## Description

This is a task-list-maker app, and it utilizes all CRUD routes to connect to a
running SQL database. This was the first major step into fullstack apps for me!

## Installation

This project does not have a start script, so clone, run `npm install`, and then
run `node server/app.js`. As long as the database is running, the app will work.
We used Postico for our SQL interface.
